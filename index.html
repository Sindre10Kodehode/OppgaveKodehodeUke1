    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>I'm the creative type. I'm a musician by trade, and a 
      future programmer. Music is my passion, and it does pay 
      some bills, but not nearly enough to keep me financially
      afloat. Because of this I have been looking into other
      options. Throughout my entire life I have had a fascination
      with the art of programming. That is exactly how I think of it; 
      an artform. I've always wanted to learn it, but never had 
      the time to get into it, until now.
      <br>
      <br>
      The past 4 years I have been playing actively in several bands. 
      I've played almost every single stage in the Porsgrunn - Skien 
      area, and everywhere else from Kristiansand to Oslo, and in between. 
      So far I've played mostly covers with "Loose Ends" and
      "Unfinished Business". I'm working on a lot of original 
      songs, but I'm too much of a perfetionist to have finished
      any of them yet.
